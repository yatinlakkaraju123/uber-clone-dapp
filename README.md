Cabs on Go

About  

Our app Cabs on Go is built to solve the problem of middlemen in cab service apps by using blockchain technology by creating a decentralized application which allows the customer to directly book a cab without having the need of a middleman which results in increased profitability for the driver as well as the customer.
 
The app uses the Ethereum blockchain to manage transactions between users. This is done using smart contracts written in Solidity, which would be deployed on the blockchain. 

The smart contracts would manage the transfer of funds between users and ensure that the carpooling transactions are executed correctly.

Insight

•	It is a D-app on Ethereum.
•	Smart contract is there in Backend.
•	Front-end is made with React.Js
•	We are using Metamask Browser Extension to work with Ethereum
•	We use the Google Map API to display maps and calculate distances between locations. This is used to determine the optimal route for carpooling and calculate the fare for the ride.
